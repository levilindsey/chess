chess
=====

A simple two-player game of chess. Levi developed this app in about a day. It includes a button to generate a random valid play for the current player. It currently does not play a game between remote machines, but Levi plans on implementing this in the future. It currently does not support an AI player, but Levi also plans on implementing a simple form of this in the future.
