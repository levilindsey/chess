# chess

#### A simple two-player game of chess.

_See the app running at [levi.dev/chess](https://levi.dev/chess)!_

Levi created this web app in a day. It includes a button to generate a random valid play for the current player. It currently does not play a game between remote machines, but Levi plans on implementing this in the future. It currently does not support an AI player, but Levi also plans on implementing a simple form of this in the future.
